# NoahIO-Opensource
Open Source Metabot



NoahIO is no Longer working due to meta switching all accounts over to an enterprise server, changing the endpoints.
I Didnt have the time to update it and no longer have the interest in completing it. 

Even though this code isnt working theres a lot of good stuff to pull from it. I removed my Authentication system for privacy reasons.
I Hope someone can use this code and make it into something that works
